// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd


-Determine number or range
-If the number is divisible by 2 without a remainder (number % 2 == 0):
-Print "The number is even"
-Else:
-Print "The number is odd"
End


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.

1. Start
2. Initialize a variable 'total' to 0
3. For each of the 5 iterations:
    a. Determine Number or use 1-15
    b. Add the number to 'total'
4. Calculate the average by dividing 'total' by 5
5. Print the average
6. End
